Possible collaborations:
- Michelson-to-Michelson optimisations (release as library)
- Contract interface specifications in JSON
- Targeting Nomadic's 'Albert' intermediate language
- Export proofs in Juvix to Mi-Cho-Coq (cool, might be tricky)

Juvix positioning:
- Usable frontend language w/dependent types that can target Michelson in the near term will be helpful
- New backends may be contentious, Nomadic is really conservative.
- Working on an R1CS backend might work well, we'd have zero competition (within Tezos ecosystem).
- Find a way to target other blockchains too without political problems. Maybe future split funding. Can happen late 2020.

General notes:
- The academic work tends to be very siloed, e.g. no collab between type theorists & ZKP proof authors
  - Cryptium has a comparative advantage working in intersections or combinations of fields
- Doing both language & protocol development gives us synergies, use them (e.g. ECC/ZKP verification instructions).
  Also maybe helpful in justifying protocol invoices which also pay for off-chain work.
- Find a way to publish papers occaisionally, it will help with academic attention & review (which is useful)
