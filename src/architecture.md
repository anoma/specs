# Architecture

The Anoma protocol suite is being designed and architected in progressive stages, each building upon the previous.

The first and most complete stage is [Namada](./architecture/namada.md). Design work is already progressing on [M2](./architecture/m2.md), [A1](./architecture/a1.md), and [J1](./architecture/j1.md) in parallel.
