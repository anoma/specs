Discussion Questions:

- General thoughts on the paper, any questions
- Clarification on terms: "ommel" (uncle), Turing-completeness, any questions
- Make sure everyone understands account message-passing model
- Make sure everyone understands gas model for computational cost-metering
- Virtual machine model (memory, storage)
- Accuracy of tracking underlying costs (storage rent? inter-contract storage?)
- Lack of scheduler
- Why deviance from Von Neumann (no code execution from memory)?
