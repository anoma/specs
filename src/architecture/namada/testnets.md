# Testnets

* Private testnets
  * Just us
* Internal testnets
  * Small select group of people
* Public testnets
  * Anyone that wants to join
* Incentivized testnets

## Proposed Timeline

* Private testnets
  * End of February
  * Things can still be janky but we should have a working chain on which we can
    test the majority of functionality
* Internal testnets
  * End of March
  * Friends and family can start running our testnets
  * We are starting to have the first UIs that are working and Ledger apps are
    in testing
* Public testnets
  * End of April
  * The software is stable enough and we have enough documentation that 
    strangers on the internet can run it
  * Trusted setup should be done.
* Incentivized testnets
  * End of May
  * The incentivized testnets can run for the next 2 months while the last 
    remaining bits are polished. Participants receive tokens and we are spending
    those 2 months gearing up for launch.
