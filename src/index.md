Anoma is a platform for self-contained self-sovereign coordination.

- _Coordination_ means that Anoma concerns itself with actions requiring communication, agreement, and/or exchange between parties.
- _Self-sovereign_ means that the protocols aim to foster alignment between users, operators, and developers.
- _Self-contained_ means that the Anoma protocols should be alone sufficient for the technological part of this coordination.

These documents describe the motivation, design rationale, architecture, and protocol details of Anoma. They are intended to be both _minimal_, in that no more is said than necessary, and _complete_, in that enough is said to define precisely what Anoma is. Anoma is a protocol, it is not an implementation. Documentation for the implementation of Anoma by Heliax can be found [here](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.4.0/).

Anoma is free, in both the senses of "free speech" and "free beer". The source for these documents is [on Github](https://github.com/anoma/spec), permissively licensed, and they can be forked or edited as you like. At present, this particular repository is stewarded by the [Anoma Foundation](https://anoma.foundation/). Contributions are welcome.
