# M1 Overview

M1 is a sovereign chain that enables full multi-asset privacy for all connected
assets. In order to make M1 a reality, we not only need a name but we also need
a lot of features besides the ZKP circuits. Over time the set of supported
features my be extended to include things like fully programmable VPs and more
advanced circuits.

## Raison d'Ãªtre

True multi-asset privacy doesn't exist at the moment anywhere. Up until now you
had the choice to build a sovereign chain that reissues assets (ie ZCash) or to
build a privacy preserving solution on existing chains (ie Tornado Cash on
Ethereum). Both have large trade-offs; in the former case users don't have
assets that they actually want to use and in the latter case users leak a ton of
metadata, it's expensive and clunky to use.

In 2022 the timing is right to launch M1, because interoperability in the form 
of IBC is starting to work in practice and that we are ready tech-wise in order
to launch something like M1.

Moreover M1 also presents a very good stepping stone to launch before mainnet
Anoma as the first chain in the Anoma ecosystem. It is expected that M1 is long
lived and supports actual assets and real value after launch; or in other words,
it's a full-fledged public blockchain.

## Proposed Features

### Cryptography

* [Multi-asset shielded pool circuit](m1/masp.md)
* [Trusted setup for the circuit](m1/masp/trusted-setup.md)

### Base Ledger

* [Proof of Stake](m1/proof-of-stake.md)
* [Governance](m1/governance.md)
* [Gas/Fee system](m1/fee-system.md)
* [Execution system](m1/execution-system.md)

### Incentives / Rewards / Economics

* Long-term incentives around PoS and Slashing
* Short-term incentives for MASP and bridges

### Bridges

* [IBC integration](m1/ibc.md)
* Bridge to IBC chains (Osmosis, Cosmos, E-Money, Terra)
* [Bridge to Ethereum](m1/ethereum-bridge.md)
* All bridges need to be thoroughly tested and running on internal testnets

### Front-ends

* Multi-chain/Multi-asset wallet that supports moving assets across bridges
  * Enables ETH to be moved to M1 and back
  * Supports staking and governance on M1
  * Enables multi-asset transfers involving the MASP
  * Integrates with existing key solutions (Ledger, Metamask, Keplr)
  * Supports whatever incentives schemes we want to have

* Block explorer
  * Display PoS state
  * Display governance state
  * Display transparent transfers
  * Display transfers in and out of the MASP
  * Display total values for the MASP
  * Allows tx hashes of shielded transfers to be looked up for confirmation
