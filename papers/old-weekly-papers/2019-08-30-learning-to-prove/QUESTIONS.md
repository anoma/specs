Discussion Questions:

- General thoughts on the paper, any questions
- they chose depth-first search, could other tree search algos be feasible?
- since the generated proofs are much shorter than the testing set proofs, could they feed the generated proofs back into the CoqGym again? Would it just make it more biased toward a specific set of tactics?
