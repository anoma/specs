# Trusted setup

## What is the Anoma Setup?
To enable private asset-agnostic bartering among any number of parties, Anoma uses a Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP) circuit which is an extension of the Sapling circuit used in Zcash. This relies on a specific class of zero-knowledge proofs called Zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs). Zk-SNARKs are secure in the common reference string (CRS) model, which assumes a trusted setup of parameters used for constructing and verifying proofs. In order to ensure the parameters are secure, we are running a Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocol, more commonly called Trusted Setup Ceremony. The ceremony guarantees that proofs cannot be forged when at least one participant is honest, and guarantee zero-knowledge even if none of the participants are honest.

## How exactly does the setup work?
A trusted setup consists in 2 phases. The first phase is circuit-agnostic, that is, anyone who wants to build a zk-SNARK can use the outputs from this phase to bootstrap their zk-SNARK. This phase is called The Powers of Tau and has already been done by Zcash. The second phase is circuit-specific and that is where we will construct our MASP zk-SNARK circuit itself.
