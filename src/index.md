# Anoma

[Anoma](http://anoma.net) is an intent-centric, privacy-preserving protocol for decentralized counterparty discovery, solving, and multi-chain atomic settlement. To learn more about Anoma's vision, take a look at the [Anoma Vision Paper](https://anoma.net/vision-paper.pdf).

These documents describe the motivation, design rationale, architecture, and protocol details of Anoma. They are intended to be both _minimal_, in that no more is said than necessary, and _complete_, in that enough is said to define precisely what Anoma is. Anoma is a protocol, it is not an implementation. Documentation for the implementation of the Anoma protocol by Heliax can be found [here](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.4.0/).

Anoma is free, in both the senses of "free speech" and "free beer". The source for these documents is [on Github](https://github.com/anoma/specs), permissively licensed, and they can be forked or edited as you like. At present, this particular repository is stewarded by the [Anoma Foundation](https://anoma.foundation/). Contributions are welcome.

This specification is designed be readable in both breadth-first and depth-first manners. If you want to understand the broad motivation and architecture of Anoma, read the [motivation](./motivation.md) and [architecture](./architecture.md) overviews. If you want to dive into the protocol details of a particular aspect of Anoma, such as the [state architecture](./architecture/state.md), or release line, such as [V1](./releases/v1.md), you can start directly with the document in question; overview documents are self-contained and/or crosslinked where necessary, and contain pointers to subprotocols and details thereof. A sitewide search function is available at the upper left.

> **NOTE:** These documents are not yet complete. If you're reading this page right now, there's a high chance you might be interested in the [V1 release line](./releases/v1.md), slated for use in the [Namada instance](https://namada.net).

Happy reading!
